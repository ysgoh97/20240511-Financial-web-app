Class practice to develop a web application integrating multiple machine learning models:

* Price prediction using Scikit-learn's linear regression model
* Text generation using Google's chat-bison-001 model
* Image generation using a Stability-AI model from [Replicate](https://replicate.com/)

The app is built with SQLite, Python, HTML, and Flask, and is deployed on [Render](https://render.com/)
